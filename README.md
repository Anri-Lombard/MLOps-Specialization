While developing machine learning models can be a complex and challenging task, it is only a small part of the work involved in bringing a machine learning project to production. In fact, the model itself typically accounts for only 5-10% of the entire project. The rest of the work involves tasks such as preparing and cleaning the data, setting up and maintaining the infrastructure to train and deploy the model, and building the software that integrates the model into a larger system. This often requires significant software development work, such as designing APIs, implementing security and privacy controls, and handling various edge cases. As a result, building and deploying machine-learning systems in production requires a combination of machine-learning expertise and software engineering skills. Many people in the machine learning community may not be aware of this, leading to a misconception that the field is primarily about building models and not about the broader engineering work involved in bringing those models to production.
